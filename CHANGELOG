================================================================================
Alpha 2
================================================================================

Bugfixes:
- Fixed room layout changes not always being applied (goron mountain water room,
  spool swamp portal).

Logic:
- OW: Using the switch hook to cross goron mountain is now in hard logic (even
  with long hook, because you can't see the bushes from the top side).
- D3: Using switch hook or long hook to reach D3 miniboss is in hard logic
  (because you can't see the pots). Also, it is actually impossible to use the
  switch hook without pegasus seeds to reach the pots. Updated logic to reflect
  this.
- D6: Removed seed shooter logic for hitting the orb without the magic boomerang
  to reach the miniboss. It's too much even for hard logic.
- D7: Fixed a loophole causing jumping on button edges without hitting the
  buttons to be in normal logic.
