Changelog for Oracles-Randomizer-NG

================================================================================
Alpha 1 (2021-01-28)
================================================================================

- Initial release based on original randomizer; seasons only.

================================================================================
Alpha 2 (2021-12-21)
================================================================================

Bugfixes:
- Fixed room layout changes not always being applied (goron mountain water room,
  spool swamp portal).
- Fixed non-crossitems logic being totally messed up by thinking that you have
  all of the ages items immediately.

Logic:
- OW: Using the switch hook to cross goron mountain is now in hard logic (even
  with long hook, because you can't see the bushes from the top side).
- D3: Using switch hook or long hook to reach D3 miniboss is in hard logic
  (because you can't see the pots). Also, it is actually impossible to use the
  switch hook without pegasus seeds to reach the pots. Updated logic to reflect
  this.
- D6: Removed seed shooter logic for hitting the orb without the magic boomerang
  to reach the miniboss. It's too much even for hard logic.
- D7: Fixed a loophole causing jumping on button edges without hitting the
  buttons to be in normal logic.

================================================================================

Features:
- Ages support complete with cross-items!

Bugfixes:
- Seasons: Fixed seed shooter graphic being corrupted in shops & some other
  places

Ages logic changes (non-crossitems related):
- D4 minecart room with stalfos: Using the seed satchel to kill the stalfos
  through the wall is no longer in logic, even hard logic. (Using
  sword/rod/fool's ore remains in normal logic, though.)
- D6 present: The water leading to the orb room full of pits is considered
  passable with only pegasus seeds + feather (bomb jump not needed). In hard
  logic, it's considered passible with only the feather, no pegasus seeds.

Other stuff:
- Attempting to enter Jabu-Jabu's Belly without the mermaid suit causes Link to
  drown. This may look a bit funny if Jabu-Jabu's belly is randomized to be
  somewhere entirely different.
