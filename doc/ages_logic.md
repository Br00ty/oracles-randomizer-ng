# Logic

"Logic" means the set of plays that the randomizer may require you to make in
order to progress in the game. Anything the vanilla game requires you to do is,
of course, in logic. Beyond that and some easy alternate tactics, the rules in
this document apply.


## Normal logic

In logic:

- Jumping over 2 tiles with feather, or 3 tiles with feather + pegasus seeds
  (subtract 1 tile if the jump is over water or lava instead of a pit)
- Using only ember seeds from the seed satchel as a weapon
- Using only ember, scent, or gale seeds from the seed shooter as a weapon
- Flipping spiked beetles using the shovel

Out of logic:

- Required damage (damage boosts, falling in pits)
- Farming rupees, assuming you spend them optimally
- Getting initial scent seeds from the plants in D3
- Getting initial bombs from Goron Shooting Gallery or Head Thwomp
- Lighting torches using mystery seeds
- Using only mystery seeds as a weapon
- Using only scent or gale seeds from the seed satchel as a weapon
- Using only bombs as a weapon, except versus armos
- Doing Patch's restoration ceremony without sword
- Getting a potion for King Zora from Maple
- Guard skip
- Various stupid tricks in D2, D3, D4, and D5
- Text warps
- Magic rings


## Hard logic

Passing the `-hard` flag to the randomizer on the command line enables the
things that are out of normal logic, with the exception of:

- Farming rupees, except by shovel RNG manips
- Mystery seeds as a weapon
- Text warps
- Magic rings
