# Oracles-Randomizer-NG differences

Oracles-Randomizer-NG does some things differently from jangler's [original
randomizer](https://github.com/jangler/oracles-randomizer), and the feature set
is also a bit different.

## General changes

### Both games

- Treewarp is always enabled.
- Advance Shop is always open. Contents are not currently randomized, though.

### Seasons

- Treasure Map: Now works in Subrosia too. If a treasure is in Subrosia, you
  won't see it sparkling on the map if you're in the overworld; you must be in
  Subrosia.

## New features

- Cross-Items: Get Ages items in Seasons, and vice-versa.
- Keysanity: Dungeon keys, maps, and compasses are scattered across the
  overworld. Compasses work anywhere, but they chime a different tune depending
  on which dungeon the key is for.

## Missing features in NG

- Multiworld
- Plando
- Linked games are disabled
