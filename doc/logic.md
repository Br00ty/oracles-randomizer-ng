# Logic

"Logic" means the set of plays that the randomizer may require you to make in
order to progress in the game. Anything the vanilla game requires you to do is,
of course, in logic. Beyond that and some easy alternate tactics, the rules in
this document apply.


## Normal logic

In logic:

- Jumping over 2 tiles with feather, 3 tiles with feather + pegasus seeds, 4
  tiles with cape, or 6 tiles with cape + pegasus seeds (subtract 1 tile if the
  jump is over water or lava instead of a pit)
- Using only ember seeds from the seed satchel as a weapon
- Using only ember, scent, or gale seeds from the slingshot as a weapon
- Flipping spiked beetles using the shovel

Out of logic:

- Anything that gives an explicit in-game warning (these are also potential
  softlocks)
- Required damage (damage boosts, falling in pits)
- Farming rupees or ore chunks, assuming you spend them optimally
- Getting a new type of mystical seed from anything other than a seed tree
- Getting initial bombs from regenerating plants
- Lighting torches using mystery seeds
- Using only bombs or mystery seeds as a weapon
- Using only scent or gale seeds from the seed satchel as a weapon
- Carrying Dimitri out of Sunken City before obtaining his flute
- Lighting the second Poe sister's torches without pegasus seeds or hyper
  slingshot
- Fighting Frypolar without slingshot
- D8 sidescrollers without cape
- Magic rings


## Hard logic

Passing the `-hard` flag to the randomizer on the command line enables the
things that are out of normal logic, with the exceptions of:

- Warnings
- Farming rupees
- Lighting more than two torches per room using mystery seeds
- Mystery seeds as a weapon
- Magic rings
