# developer notes

## notable code addresses

the names of these, when present, correspond to the ones in drenn's
ages-disasm. the most useful are:

- $10bf = when this executes, (hl) and (hl+1) here are the current chest item
  ID and sub ID.
- $0205 = checks for bit a in the flags starting at hl. $1717 does this
  specifically at $c692 (treasure flags), and $30b3 does this specifically at
  $c6ca (global flags).
- $0b:4409 = when this executes, (hl) and (hl+1) are the given item ID and sub ID.
  this is for keys falling from ceilings, npcs giving items, basically anything
  other than chests and some very special cases.
- $11:58df = parseGivenObjectData. when this executes, de is the address of the
  start of an object's data. it is called n+1 times if there are n objects in a
  room as you enter. objects include enemies, puzzles, and special behaviors
  like what normally happens in the sword room of the hero's cave.
- $15:466b = hl-1 here is the index of the treasure item's info (collection
  mode, param, text, and sprite, in that order). in other words, (hl) is the
  treasure item's param.

others that might be good to know:

- $0e3b = drawObject
- $16eb = giveTreasure, which i believe offsets the treasure paramsuch that it
  needs to be passed as one higher than usual. e.g. if you want $00, pass $01.
- $271a = createTreasure
- $3ab2 = getFreeInteractionSlot, called when a new "interaction" is needed.
  this is used when a room's interactions are loaded, and when some other event
  happens, like a monster falling into a pit.

## notable ram addresses

these all get checked in a normal frame, just for display purposes:

- $c680-$c6?? = inventory (starting with equipped items)
- $c6a2/$c6a3 = health / max health
- $c6a6 = rupees
- $c6c5 = active ring
- $c6ca-$c6d9 = some global flags
- $c8a6 = ?
- $cc4c = active room

other things:

- $c63f-$c640 = bought shop items
- $c643-$c646 = companion state (ricky, dimitri, moosh, then misc.)
	- shop checks for bit 5 of ricky
- $c692-$c6a1 = item flags
- $c6bb = essences obtained?
	- shop checks for bit 1â€¦ wait, that means second essence. damn it

## notable rom addresses

- $15:57FD + $4X = index of ring given by param X; params below 4 don't
  (normally?) work. this is a generalization of the information described for
  $15:466b.

## stuff just about the sword

- $0A:7B47 is the routine that runs every frame in the room. this is the object
  with interaction c6.
- $0A:7B63 executes when the box is opened. it plays the animation and gives
  you the item.
- $0A:7B9C executes when the text is cleared. it gives you the item *again*,
  spin slashes, and fades to white.
