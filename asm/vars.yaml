# the items in this file don't usually change data themselves; instead they
# track the locations of data which will be changed after randomization.

seasons:
  # horon village is random, natzu and desert are summer only, and goron
  # mountain is winter only. northern peak doesn't matter (it might become
  # spring after you beat the game). note that these names don't correspond 1:1
  # with the names used on the overworld map, which aren't delineated based on
  # season boundaries.
