# TODO

## high priority

- clean up the code, make it logical, comprehensible, and presentable for a
  third party
	- maybe only return true/false from getmark/peekmark?
- write readme
- make tests pass

## mid priority

- seeds
	- try changing satchel to start with a different type of seed
	- try putting seeds in chests and see if it affects the drops you can get
	- try randomizing trees
- rod
- verify that dungeons are completeable in *any* possible key order

## low priority

- subrosian dance hall -> dimitri's flute
- scramble dungeons? before the randomization step
