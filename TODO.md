# TODO

## high priority

- have a routine that finds all absolutely required items for a given goal

## mid priority

- have pointgen optimize nodes
- seeds
	- try changing satchel to start with a different type of seed
	- try putting seeds in chests and see if it affects the drops you can get
	- try randomizing trees
- rod
- verify that dungeons are completeable in *any* possible key order

## low priority

- maybe only return true/false from getmark/peekmark?
- subrosian dance hall -> dimitri's flute
- scramble dungeons? before the randomization step
