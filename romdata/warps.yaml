# "entry/exitlabel" is the label where the dungeon entrance/exit warp source
# data is defined, while "entry/exitindex" is the index within the referenced
# table to modify. index is multiplied by 4 before being added.
#
# warp destinations for getting essences behave differently. they are four-byte
# table entries that go directly to warp variables (no further indexing).
#
# entries only need map tile info for the purposes of the treasure map.
